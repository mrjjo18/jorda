    "The Monty Hall problem is based on a game show called *Let's Make a Deal*. If you are a contestant on the show, here's how the game works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The host, Monty Hall, shows you three closed doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. He tells you that there is a prize behind each door.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One prize is valuable (traditionally a car), the other two are less valuable (traditionally goats).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you guess right, you get to keep the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you pick Door 1. Before opening the door you chose, Monty opens Door 3 and reveals a goat. Then Monty offers you the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize your chance of winning the car, should you stick with Door 1 or switch to Door 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have to make some assumptions about the behavior of the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Monty always opens a door and offers you the option to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  He never opens the door you picked or the door with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If you choose the door with the car, he chooses one of the other\n",
    "    doors at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, you are better off switching. \n",
    "If you stick, you win $1/3$ of the time. If you switch, you win $2/3$ of the time.\n",

    "If you have not encountered this problem before, you might find that\n",

    "intuition that it doesn't matter if you stick or switch. There are two\n",
    "doors left, they reason, so the chance that the car is behind Door A is 50%. But that is wrong.\n",

    "To see why, it can help to use a Bayes table. We start with three\n",

    "\n",
    "If the Monty Hall problem makes your head hurt, you are not alone.  But I think it demonstrates the power of Bayes's Theorem as a divide-and-conquer strategy for solving tricky problems.  And I hope it provides some insight into *why* the answer is what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Monty opens a door, he provides information we can use to update our belief about the location of the car.  Part of the information is obvious.  If he opens Door 3, we know the car is not behind Door 3.  But part of the information is more subtle.  Opening Door 3 is more likely if the car is behind Door 2, and less likely if it is behind Door 1.  So the data is evidence in favor of Door 2.  We will come back to this notion of evidence in future chapters.\n",

    "In the next chapter we'll extend the Cookie Problem and the Dice Problem, and take the next step from basic probability to Bayesian statistics.\n",
